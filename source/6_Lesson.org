- Below is a simulation of how a CPU can carry out instructions.
- You can type commands into the RAM addresses, and the virtual CPU will execute them.
- Here are a list of the commands that can be accepted.
  - 1xx =Add value in address xx to the value in the accumulator=
  - 2xx =Subtract value in address xx from the value in the accumulator=
  - 3xx =Store the value of the accumulator to address xx=
  - 5xx =Load the value from address xx to the accumulator=
  - 6xx =Set the program counter to address xx==
  - 7xx =If the accumulator contains the value 0 then set the counter to address xx=
  - 8xx =If the accumulator contains a value greater than 0 then set the counter to address xx=
  - 901 =Store user input into the accumulator=
  - 902 =Output the value in the accumulator=
  - 000 =Halt the program=
